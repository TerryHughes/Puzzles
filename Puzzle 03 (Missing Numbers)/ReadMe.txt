Find missing numbers from an unsorted array of sequential numbers starting from 1.

Few examples
Array		Size	Missing Numbers
[5,1,4,3]	4	2
[2, 6, 4, 5]	6	1, 3
[4, 1, 3, 2]	6	5, 6
[]		2	1,2
[1,2,3,4,5]	5	None

Efficiency of the solutions will be measured in time and space dimensions.

Preferred Method signature:
IEnumerable<int> GetMissingNumbers(int[] array, int size)
